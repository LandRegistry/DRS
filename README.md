## Viewing the protoypes.

Contact a member of the team - e.g. look at the github history (people external to HMLR), or [Sharepoint](https://landregistryuk.sharepoint.com/sites/NewBuildsDiscovery) (HMLR colleagues) to get the username and password to [view the prototypes](https://drs-prototype.herokuapp.com)


## Adding to this protoype

Speak to Digital registration service team (find us on Sharepoint [internal organisation site])

Made from v9.2 of the gov.uk protoype kit

Go to the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit site](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs) to download the latest version and read the documentation.

### About the prototype kit

The prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

Read the [project principles](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/principles).

### Security

If you publish your prototypes online, they **must** be protected by a [username and password](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/publishing-on-heroku). This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like GOV.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.
