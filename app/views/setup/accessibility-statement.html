    <p class="govuk-body">This website is run by HM Land Registry. We want as many people as possible to be able to use it. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">HM Land Registry is committed to making its website accessible,
    in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard. </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
    <ul class="govuk-list">
      <li>Users cannot return to the start of the journey once they have begun. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA criterion 2.4.5 (Multiple Ways).</li>
      <br>
      <li>Some headings appear clipped. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA criterion 1.4.10 (Reflow). </li>
      <br>
      <li>The red delete button sometimes appears green when tabbing through the page. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA criterion 3.2.1 (On Focus). </li>
      <br>
      <li>The highlight colour shown when using the tab key to navigate through links is sometimes inconsistent. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA criterion 2.4.7 (Focus Visible). </li>
      <br>
      <li>Some parts of the ‘Select lender representation’ function will not be visible to screen readers. This fails WCAG 2.1 A criterion 4.1.1 (Validate the HTML). </li>
      <br>
      <li>Some selected radio buttons do not remain selected when returned to. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA criterion 3.2.3 (Consistent Navigation). </li>
      <br>
      <li>In a few instances, users are not informed that links will open in a new window or tab. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA criterion 2.4.4 (Link Purpose). </li>
      <br>
      <li>Some tables do not have captions to help those using assistive technology. This fails WCAG 2.1 AA criterion 1.3.2 (Meaningful Sequence). </li>

    </ul>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Disproportionate burden</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">It is not considered that any aspect of HM Land Registry’s services will fall into this category.  Areas of non-compliance with the guidelines are detailed in other sections of this statement.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">PDFs and other documents</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body"> The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made">accessibility regulations</a> do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we do not plan to fix <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transfer-under-a-chargees-power-of-sale">Transfer under a chargee’s power of sale (PG75)</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How we tested this website</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">This website was last tested on 1 May 2020. Tests were carried out by an independent internal audit team using a purpose-built test suite.

      We aim to fix the reported defects by 30 September 2020.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We've written this statement based on the defects found on 1 May 2020. As we are still building this service, we'll continue to test it and all new pages. We'll update this statement as we find or fix any defects.</p>
      <br>

      <p class="govuk-body">This statement was prepared on 1 June 2020. </p>
