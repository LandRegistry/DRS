    Full title guarantee: the transferor(s) guarantee, to the best of their knowledge, that there are no financial charges/encumbrances
    (such as mortgages) or other third party interests (such as rights of way/leases) which affect the property other than those already revealed
    to the transferee(s)
    <br><br>
    Limited title guarantee: a more restricted set of promises by the transferor(s). This guarantees that the transferor(s) have
    not themselves created, or allowed to be created, any charge, encumbrance or third party interest that still exists at the date of the transfer.
